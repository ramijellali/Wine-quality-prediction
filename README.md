🍷 Wine Quality Prediction



Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. 🍇🍷

📁 Project Structure
📊 Data Preprocessing:

🧪 Extracting features and the target variable.
⚖️ Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
🔄 Label binarization for the target variable to classify wine as good or bad.
🤖 Model Training:

📂 Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
🌲 Training a Random Forest Classifier on the training data.
📈 Model Evaluation:

🔍 Predicting on test data.
🎯 Calculating accuracy score.
🧪 Sample prediction using a new input.
🚀 Getting Started
Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have all the necessary Python packages installed. You can install the required packages with:


Run the Notebook:
Open the Jupyter notebook Untitled5.ipynb and run the cells sequentially to train the model and evaluate its performance.

Make Predictions:
Modify the input_data variable to test the model with new data inputs and see if the wine is predicted to be of good quality or not.

📊 Results
The model predicts whether the wine is of good quality based on the input chemical properties. The final accuracy of the model is displayed in the notebook.
